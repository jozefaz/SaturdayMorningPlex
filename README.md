# SaturdayMorningPlex

Automatically generate Saturday morning cartoon-style weekly playlists for your Plex server!

## ✨ Features

- 🎬 **Automated Playlist Generation** - Creates 52 weekly playlists per year
- 🎯 **Content Rating Filtering** - Filter shows by G, PG, PG-13, TV-Y, TV-Y7, etc.
- 📺 **Smart Distribution** - Each week gets one episode from each show
- 🔄 **Multi-Season Support** - Automatically continues to next seasons
- 📅 **Multi-Year Generation** - Creates playlists until all episodes are included
- 🐳 **Docker & UnRAID Ready** - Easy deployment with Docker or UnRAID
- 🌐 **Web Interface** - Simple, intuitive control panel

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Connect to Plex** - Authenticate with your Plex Media Server
2. **Filter Shows** - Select content ratings (e.g., G, PG)
3. **Generate Playlists** - Creates weekly playlists:
   - Week 1: One episode from each show (S01E01 of all shows)
   - Week 2: Next episode from each show (S01E02 of all shows)
   - Week 3: Continue pattern...
   - When a show runs out of season 1, moves to season 2
4. **Multiple Years** - Continues creating years until all episodes are used

### Example Output

If you have 3 shows with content rating "G":
- Show A: 26 episodes (2 seasons, 13 each)
- Show B: 39 episodes (3 seasons, 13 each)
- Show C: 52 episodes (4 seasons, 13 each)

The generator creates:
- **Year 1**: 52 weeks, each with 3 episodes (one from each show)
- **Year 2**: Continues with remaining episodes
- **Year 3**: Final episodes from Show C

Result: **3 years × 52 weeks = 156 playlists** covering all 117 episodes!

**Method 3: Using curl**
```bash
curl -u 'YOUR_EMAIL:YOUR_PASSWORD' 'https://plex.tv/users/sign_in.xml' \\

### Content Rating Examples

- **G Only**: `CONTENT_RATINGS=G`
- **PG Only**: `CONTENT_RATINGS=PG`
- **G and PG**: `CONTENT_RATINGS=G,PG`
